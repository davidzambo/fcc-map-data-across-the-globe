# fcc-map-data-across-the-globe
### User Stories:
 - I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.
 - I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.
 - I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.

Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/meteorite-strike-data.json
